# hello-world

Hey there!

I am Joy Hatake, and I love to make programs which can do interesting stuff.
Such as, a program which checks the total number of times a specific word is uttered in a youtube video etc.
(I know the example was oddly specific lol)

My other hobbies include 3D Modelling with blender, Speedcubing and making pixel art.
At the time of writing this, my programming knowledge consists of basic fundamentals of coding and a small understanding of Python syntax.
